\section{A short introduction to computer programming, using Groovy}

\subsection{Summary of the language features mentioned in this introduction}

\begin{tabular}{@{\ttfamily}l l}
// & Introduces a comment\\
int i & Defines an integer variable called \texttt{i}\\
int x, y & Defines integer variables called \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}\\
boolean b & Defines a boolean variable called \texttt{b}\\
String s & Defines a string variable called \texttt{s}\\
int num = 0 & Defines and initializes an integer variable called \texttt{num}\\
num = sc.nextInt() & Takes a value from the input and puts it into \texttt{num}\\
s = sc.next() & Takes a string from the input (ignoring leading spaces) \\
& and puts it into \texttt{s}\\
s = sc.nextLine() & Takes a whole line from the input and puts it into \texttt{s}\\
print num; & Outputs the value of \texttt{num}\\
print "The answer is " + x & Outputs "The answer is " followed by the value of \texttt{x}\\
print  s + x; & Outputs the value of \texttt{s} followed by the value of \texttt{x}\\
println() & Outputs an end-of-line\\
x = 99 & Assigns the value 99 to \texttt{x}\\
+, ---, *, /, \% & Arithmetic operators.  *, / and \% take precedence over + and ---\\
s.length() & Gives length of string \texttt{s}\\
s.substring(x, y) & Gives substring of \texttt{s} starting at character position x \\
& and ending at character position y\\
 & (The first character of the string is character zero.)\\
if (A) B; else C; & If A is true, do B, else do C.\\
(x == y) & Tests whether \texttt{x} is equal to \texttt{y}.  Note double "="\\
!=, > <, >=, <= & Not equal to, greater than, less than, etc\\
\{ & Used to bracket together separate statements\\
\} & to make them into a block\\
while (A) B; & While A is true, do B.  B can be a block.\\
true, false & The boolean values \texttt{true} and\texttt{ false}.\\
!, \verb+&&+, or !!  & The boolean operators \emph{not}, \emph{and} and \emph{or}.\\
\end{tabular}

\noindent and
\verb+Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)+  sets up the input for reading.
