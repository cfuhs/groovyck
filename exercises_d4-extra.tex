\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Several student have commented that they found some difficulties
understanding how data structures are set in memory. These four
exercises are given as additional practice. 

Students can solve them using pen and paper. The goal is to read
the code, understand it, and produce diagrams that explain the state
of variables (simple and complex types) in memory at every numbered
point (in comments). The points are not numbered in any particular
order, and the program may go through each point more than once. 

If
the students find them confusing, or they want to confirm that their
understanding is right, they are encourage to show their proposed
solutions to the lecturers to receive feedback on the first three
exercises. The fourth exercise is a marked assignment (see below). 

\section*{Graded assignment}
\label{sec:graded-assignment}

The three first programs are provided as additional practice for
students. The fourth one is the first graded assignment for this
course. Students should submit their solutions on paper. Pen-drawing
is fine as long as \textbf{it is clear}; there is no need for fancy
computer-generated diagrams. To submit, hand your diagrams to any
member of the teaching body: Peng Du, Sergio Gutierrez-Santos, or
Sokratis Karkalas. Do not forget to put your name in all the pages.
