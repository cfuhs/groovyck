% Intro: 
%   What are exceptions?
%   We have seen some already

% How do they work
%   If something exceptional happens, an exception is thrown. It will go
%   ``up'' until it is caught. If it is not caught, it will stop the
%   program. 

%   It is important to note that they go up the stack trace,
%   interrupting every single method, until they get to the main method,
%   and then interrupt it again. 

%   Example...

% How to handle them
%   try/catch constructs
%   finally

% Checked exception and unchecked (runtime) exceptions
%   checked must be caught 
%     or declared as thrown (so that somebody else catches them)
