\textbf{Important note: } If anything is unclear, or you have any 
sort of problem (e.g.,
downloading or installing Groovy on your computer), please send an
email to Sergio Gutierrez-Santos (\emph{sergut@dcs.bbk.ac.uk}).

\textbf{Acknowledgements: } I am in great debt with 
Keith Mannock for his invaluable help in the initial stages of
preparing this document, and also with Roger Mitton for his C++ notes
(based on work by S.P. Connolly) that influenced its genesis. 
Thanks to all reviewers that have helped to 
find typos, errors, and omisions. Although they are too numerous to
name them all, I could not go without mentioning Alexandra
Poulovassilis for her \emph{beyond the call of duty} efforts clean
these notes free of numerical, syntactical, and typographical
\emph{bugs}. Any errors that you, my dear reader, may still find are
only my own fault.

% Week 1: welcome to CS!  (assumption: they read the notes already!)
% \item Basics: variables, types, initialization, comments
% \item Flow control: branches, loops
%    inc. loops they have not seen yet like for, do/while
% \item Source code version control
% and lots of exercises, because there is nothing else to tell...

% Week 2: getting up to speed, but not quite
% \item Simple and complex data types: primitive types, strings,
% (multi-dimensional) arrays
%   exercise: enter a matrix and tell if it is simmetrical

% Week 3: From Groovy to Java (only 1 day)
% \item Introduction to classes and objects: initialization, methods,
% and constructors
%   no main method, no real java today: continue working from Groovy
%   script
%      - explain some basic classes and their main methods, like String
%      (equals, substring(*), length (*), intValue, doubleValue),
%      Integer (parseInt), Math, System, introduce them to JavaDocs
%      - make them do exercises with their own classes

% Week 4: Pointers! (three days)
% \item Data structures: lists, stacks, trees, maps (and iterators)\ldots
%       including exercises in creating their own structures
%       themselves -> correct them with JUnit to show them the tests
%       the week after.
%   at the beginning, introduce real Java: needed for Testing with
%      Junit4 anyway
%      a) main method (optional)
%      b) class structure
%      c) no more println -> System.out.println()
%      d) no more String comparisons with "==" -> make an exercise
%        or an example about it

% Week 5: Testing (...whether they have learnt anything yet)
% \item Software testing and testing-driven development
%       Show them the tests that test whether their versions work the
%       same as the versions of the Java library.
% \item Ultra-brief introduction to annotations in Java
% \item JavaDoc: document inputs, output, and rationale

% Week 6: Padding week to recover their breath
% \item Introduction to generics and annotations in Java
% \item More on object orientation: inheritance, polymorphism,
%   overloading, "static" (good "real" example: implementation of
%   read-only versions of collections), interfaces (like Iterable, 
%   Runnable, or the ones in the Collections)... and why interfaces
%   are important. 

% Week 7: Recursion!
% \item Recursion

% Week 8: Exceptions and (finally) I/O (files, mostly)
% \item Exception Handling
%   plus checked exceptions, runtime exceptions, and 
%   never do "catch (Exception e) {}"!
% \item I/O in Java


% Week 9: Network programming (which means more I/O)
% \item Network programming

% Week 10: Concurrency
% \item Concurrent programming
