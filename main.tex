\textbf{Important note: } If anything is unclear, or you have any 
sort of problem (e.g.,
downloading or installing Groovy on your computer), please send an
email to Sergio Gutierrez-Santos (\emph{sergut@dcs.bbk.ac.uk}).

\textbf{Acknowledgements: } I am in great debt with 
Keith Mannock for his invaluable help in the initial stages of
preparing this document, and also with Roger Mitton for his C++ notes
(based on work by S.P. Connolly) that influenced its genesis. 
Thanks to all reviewers that have helped to 
find typos, errors, and omisions. Although they are too numerous to
name them all, I could not go without mentioning Alexandra
Poulovassilis for her \emph{beyond the call of duty} efforts clean
these notes free of numerical, syntactical, and typographical
\emph{bugs}. Any errors that you, my dear reader, may still find are
only my own fault.

% Day 0: what do I want from you?
%   - to be self-sufficient learners
%   - to be able to read code
%   - to be able to write code

% Week 1: welcome to CS!  (assumption: they read the notes already!)
% \item Basics: variables, types, initialization, comments
% \item Flow control: branches, loops
%    add switch/case and ternary operator
%    leave for loops for lists
%    leave do/while for Java, because there is not in Groovy
% \item Source code version control
% and lots of exercises, because there is nothing else to tell...
\chapter{Week 1: Here it all begins\ldots}
\input{section1-Intro,basicIO,variables}
\input{section2-Variables,integers,strings,comments}
\input{section3-If,else}
\input{section4-Booleans,while}
\input{section5-doWhile,switch,ternary}

% Week 2: getting up to speed, but not quite
% \item Simple and complex data types: primitive types (introducing
%    float and double), strings, arrays and multi-dimensional 
%    arrays, classes without methods... use of "new"
% 
%   exercise: enter a matrix and tell if it is simmetrical
% \item For loops
% \item Functions/Procedures/Methods
\chapter{Week 2: Moving on\ldots}
\input{w2-simpleAndComplexDataTypes}

% Week 3: From Groovy to Java (only 1 day)
% \item Introduction to classes and objects: initialization and
% constructors ("new" explained), methods,parameters (look at week 4
%   in C++) 
%   no main method, no real java today: continue working from Groovy
%   script
%      - explain some basic classes and their main methods, like String
%      (equals, substring(*), length (*), intValue, doubleValue),
%      Integer (parseInt), Math, System
%      - introduce them to JavaDocs

%      - make them do exercises with their own classes: create them, 
%   make objects, use them

% Week 4: Pointers! (three days)
% \item Data structures: lists, stacks, trees, maps (and iterators)\ldots
%       including exercises in creating their own structures
%       themselves -> correct them with JUnit to show them the tests
%       the week after.
% \item day 1: Real java: all files are classes, the main method,
%            System.out.println(); bye, bye, Groovy scripts,
%            introduce pointers and use it for creating a linked
%            list (a growing array) 
% \item day 2: More on data structures: queues and stacks, iterators,
%            JavaDoc: document inputs, output, and rationale 
% \item day 3: More on data structures: trees and maps; for-each loops
% 
%   at the beginning, introduce real Java: needed for Testing with
%      Junit4 anyway
%      a) main method (optional)
%      b) class structure
%      c) no more println -> System.out.println()
%      d) no more String comparisons with "==" -> make an exercise
%        or an example about it

% Week 5: Testing (...whether they have learnt anything yet)
% \item Software testing and testing-driven development
%       Show them the tests that test whether their versions work the
%       same as the versions of the Java library.
% IMPORTANT: HOW DO YOU RUN TESTS WITHOUT ECLIPSE (from cmd)!!
% \item Ultra-brief introduction to annotations in Java
% \item JavaDoc: document inputs, output, and rationale

% Week 6: Padding week to recover their breath
% \item Introduction to generics and annotations in Java
% \item More on object orientation: inheritance, polymorphism,
%   overloading, overriding, "static" (good "real" example:
%   implementation of 
%   read-only versions of collections), interfaces (like Iterable, 
%   Runnable, or the ones in the Collections)... and why interfaces
%   are important. 
% \item Exercise Make a class that extends String and overwrites
%     toString() to call super.super.toString(), and then pass it to a
%     println(). 
% \item Maybe a sample test, like Roger Mitton does?(remember you
% have a spare week (it's 11 not 10, count them JIC))

% Week 7: Recursion!
% \item Recursion
% \item The execution stack (they will see it next week, if they have
%     not yet)

% Week 8: Exceptions and (finally) I/O (files, mostly)
% \item Exception Handling
%   plus checked exceptions, runtime exceptions, and 
%        never do "catch (Exception e) {}"!
%   plus the 3 Abrahams guarantees
% \item I/O in Java


% Week 9: Network programming (which means more I/O)
% \item Network programming

% Week 10: Concurrency
% \item Concurrent programming
