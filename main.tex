\textbf{Important note: } If anything is unclear, or you have any 
sort of problem (e.g.,
downloading or installing Groovy on your computer), please send an

\textbf{Acknowledgements: } I am in great debt with Roger Mitton and
Keith Mannock for their invaluable help in the initial stages of
preparing this document. Thanks to all reviewers that have helped to
find typos, errors, and omisions. Although they are too numerous to
mention them all, I could not go without mentioning Alexandra
Poulovassilis. Any errors that you, my dear reader, may still find are
only my own fault. \newpage

% Week 1: welcome to CS!  (assumption: they read the notes already!)
% \item Basics: variables, types, initialization, comments
% \item Flow control: branches, loops
% \item Source code version control
% and lots of exercises, because there is nothing else to tell...

% Week 2: getting up to speed, but not quite
% \item Simple and complex data types: primitive types, strings,
% (multi-dimensional) arrays

% Week 3: From Groovy to Java (only 1 day)
% \item Introduction to classes and objects: initialization, methods,
% and constructors

% Week 4: Pointers! (three days)
% \item Data structures: lists, stacks, trees, maps (and iterators)\ldots
%       including exercises in creating their own structures
%       themselves -> correct them with JUnit to show them the tests
%       the week after.

% Week 5: Testing (...whether they have learnt anything yet)
% \item Software testing and testing-driven development
%       Show them the tests that test whether their versions work the
%       same as the versions of the Java library.
% \item Ultra-brief introduction to annotations in Java
% \item JavaDoc: document inputs, output, and rationale

% Week 6: Padding week to recover their breath
% \item Introduction to generics and annotations in Java
% \item More on object orientation: inheritance, polymorphism,
%   overloading, "static" (good "real" example: implementation of
%   read-only versions of collections), interfaces (like Iterable, 
%   Runnable, or the ones in the Collections)... and why interfaces
%   are important. 

% Week 7: Recursion!
% \item Recursion

% Week 8: Exceptions and (finally) I/O (files, mostly)
% \item Exception Handling
% \item I/O in Java

% Week 9: Network programming (which means more I/O)
% \item Network programming

% Week 10: Concurrency
% \item Concurrent programming
