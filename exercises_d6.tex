\section*{Learning goals}
\label{sec:learning-goals}

Before the next day, you should have achieved the following learning
goals: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Create full-Java programs, without any reliance on Groovy. These
  programs must be completely object-oriented and launch from the main
  method of one of the classes.
\item Understand how the \verb+do...while+ loop structure works and
  when to use it instead of a \verb+while+ loop. 
\end{itemize}

You should be able to finish most of non-star exercises in the
lab. Remember that star exercises are more difficult. Do not try them
unless the normal ones are clear to you.
