\section{Big enough (*)}
\label{sec:big-enough}

Write a small program that asks for the names and IDs of all employees
in a small company, and store them in an array of integers and an
array of Strings. 

This is similar to the example from the notes, but you do not know the
number of employees in advance. Read the names and IDs of employees
until the user enters an empty name (i.e. length 0) or an ID equal to
0.

Once you have finished reading employee data, go through the employee
list and print the names and IDs of
those employees whose ID is even or their names start with ``S''. 

(Hint: As you do not know how many employees you need in advance, you
will need a growing array. Create a small array, if it gets full
create an array twice as big, copy all data to the new array, and
discard the old array).
