\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Launching a start-up company is difficult. Apart from creating a great
product, you must talk to a lot of people to get them interested in
the project: clients, venture capital, government agencies\ldots it is
really difficult to keep track of everybody! 

When is your next meeting? Who will you meet? What did they say the
last time you talked to them?

The purpose of this assignment it writing a program to keep track of
contacts and meetings. The application will keep track of contacts,
past and future meetings, etc. When the application is closed, all
data must be stored in a text file called "\emph{contacts.txt}". This
file must be read at startup to recover all data introduced in a
former session (the format of the file if up to you: you can use XML,
comma-separated values (CSV), or any other format).

\section{Implementation details}
\label{sec:impl-deta}

The program should implement the interfaces
provided below. Classes that implement an interface should have the same
name with the ``Impl'' suffix unless there is more than one. For
example, if there is only one class that implements
\verb+ContactManager+, it must be called \verb+ContactManagerImpl+. Be
careful with this, as it may interfere with automatic tools that will
analyse your code. 

\subsection{ContactManager}
\label{sec:contactmanager}

% Maybe we can make them create a set that comes chronologically
% ordered? ...for next year \ \

\section{Submission and grading}
\label{sec:submission-grading}

The assignment must be pushed to a project called
\verb+ContactManager+ on your GitHub account. It will be automatically
cloned on 27$^{th}$ January at 23h59.59 GMT (full-time students)
or on 17$^{th}$ February at 23h59.59 GMT (part-time students). 
You are encouraged to
leave everything ready well in advance ---both the programming and
pushing it to your GitHub account--- to avoid last-minute problems 
(e.g.~GitHub may be down on that weekend for maintenance). If the
code is not available at the GitHub account by the deadline, the mark
will not be marked. 

The assignment will be graded according to its compliance with the
provided specification; the simplicity, clarity, and generality of
the code (including succint but illustrative comments and JavaDoc);
and the compliance with good practices of version control 
(e.g.~commiting often and in small pieces, use of descriptive commit
messages, committing only source code and not binary or class files). 

Regardless of the times you choose to \emph{push} your changes to
GitHub, you should \emph{commit} early and often. In case of suspected
plagiarism, your version control history will be used as additional
evidence to judge the case. It is in your best interest to commit very
often (and to use adequate commit messages) to make it clear that the
process of creation is entirely your own.
