\section*{Learning goals}
\label{sec:learning-goals}

Before the next day, you should have achieved the following learning
goals: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Strengthen your knowledge of JUnit4, practicing the use of the
  new annotations.
\item Understand the Test-Driven Development methodology. 
\item Understand the use of \verb+final+.
\item Understand how JavaDoc is used.
\end{itemize}

You should be able to finish most of non-star exercises in the lab. 
Remember that star exercises are more difficult. 
\textbf{Do not try star-exercises unless the other ones are clear to
  you}.  

\section{Final is final}
\label{sec:final-final}

Look at the following code. Is everything OK?



\section{Practicing TDD: }
\label{sec:jj}

At every stage, you must follow the following steps: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate the tests for the functionality required for that
  stage. Check that the new tests fail while the old ones pass.
\item Generate the minimum code that passes all the new tests.
\item Refactor the code to make it clearer, if needed.
\item Document the
  code if it has not been done yet. Update the JacaDoc documentation
  (on a separate \verb+www+ folder). 
\end{enumerate}
