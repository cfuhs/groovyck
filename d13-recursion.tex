Recursion
  - def
  - factorial
  - fibonacci
  - hanoi towers
  - need for a base case, where recursion ends (or infinite recursion)
    - if infinite recursion -> stack overflow
  - takes more stack space, but usually improves legibility
  - search for something that can only be done recursively
    - there is no such thing, this is a consequence of the
      Turing-Church conjecture.  
  - cpu vs memory: dynamic programming
    - memoizing
    - fibonacci example
  - divide and conquer
    - example in real life: sorting postal mail (thanks to Knuth)
    - binary search
    - quick sort
    - Advantages: easier to parallelise -> will come to it again

Exercises
  - Greatest common divisor
  - Length of a queue
  - merge sort
  - Finding longest common subsequence
  - Root finding for a polynomial (one between -1000 and 1000 if
      sign(f(min)) != sign(f(max)) , as many as possible for **)
