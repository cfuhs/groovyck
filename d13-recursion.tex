\section{Recursion}
\label{sec:recursion}



% Recursion
%   - def
%   - factorial
%   - fibonacci
%   - Stack diagrams
%     - Stack overflow, see below
%       - Symptom of a recursive call, usually (maybe hidden)
%   - hanoi towers
%   - Pitfalls: 
%     - no base case, where recursion ends (or infinite recursion)
%       - if infinite recursion -> stack overflow
%     - no convergence -
%       - another stack overflow
%   - takes more stack space, but usually improves legibility
%   - search for something that can only be done recursively
%     - there is no such thing, this is a consequence of the
%       Turing-Church conjecture.  
%   - cpu vs memory: dynamic programming
%     - memoizing
%     - fibonacci example
%   - divide and conquer
%     - example in real life: sorting postal mail (thanks to Knuth)
%     - binary search
%     - quick sort
%     - Advantages: easier to parallelise -> will come to it again

% Exercises
%   - write numbers...  then check
%   - What is wrong with this exercise? (check for 0 is too late!)
%   - Greatest common divisor ( p > q => gcd(p,q) = gcd(q, p % q) )
%   - Anagrams of n letters
%   - Length of a queue
%   - Power of a number
%   - Koch star?
%   - Din-A4, etc
%   - merge sort
%   - Finding longest common subsequence
%   - Root finding for a polynomial (one between -1000 and 1000 if
%       sign(f(min)) != sign(f(max)) , as many as possible for **)
%   - Memoization: Collatz problem
%   - Memoization: McCarthy
%   - 8 dames on a chess board
%   - Towers of Hanoi variant: odd vs even
%   - Dominoes
%   - How big is your stack?
