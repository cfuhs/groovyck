\label{sec:polymorphyism}

Polymorphism is the ability of an entity to show diferent shapes or
forms. In biology, polymorphic animals can exist isa variety of
different forms, e.g.~male and female animals, or different blood
types. In materials science, polymorphic material can exist in a
variety of different crystaline configurations (e.g.~calcite and
aragonite). 

In computer science, polymorphism appears at many levels. In
Programming in Java, we interested in two types of polymorphism:
polymorphic classes and polymorphic methods. The former is usually
referred to as \emph{generic types}, while the latter is usually
called \emph{method overloading}.
