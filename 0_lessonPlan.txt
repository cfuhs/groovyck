*** Day 5 ***
* Introduction: 
  Tell them that recursion is very difficult. 

* Activity
  Live activity: difference between iterative and recursive

* Conclusion
  Iterative           vs   Recursive
   - from "outside"   vs   from "inside"
   - small stack      vs   high stack
   - for/while loop   vs   method call and stop condition


*** Day 6 ***
* Introduction
  Introducing (real) Java at last. Remind them the transition will happen also on Day 7.  
  Pair programming - session 1

* Activity

* Conclusion: 



*** Day 7 ***
*  Introduction
  - Transition to Java complete! 
  - Remind them that pointers is very difficult. 

* Activity: 
  - Ejercise on board about list, adding element, removing element,
    adding/removing first elemennt and last element
  - Remember that first element must be added or removed from
    OUTSIDE the list

* Post: 
  - We have completed the transition to Java
  - We have introduced pointers. We have two more days. 


*** Day 8 ***
* Pre: 
  - Interfaces
  - More pointers
  - Pair-programming

* Activity: 
  Live programming of a Queue + 
  + Live activity implementing a Queue
  NEED: Numbers printed

* Post: 


*** Day 9 ***
* Introduction:
  - Pointer! Easy by now, right?

* During:

* Conclusion
  - Last day of pointers: you have mastered them, right?
  - Trees are easier recursively than iteratively


*** Day 10 ***
* Pre: 
Three legs in OOP: 
  - Encapsulation
    - Already seen: private fields!
      - Only exception covered today: "final"
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism

* During:

* Post: 
  - Private, package, protected, public
